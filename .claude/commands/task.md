Convert the plan into executable Codex tasks.

Read:

- .flow/decision.md
- .flow/plan.md

Write .flow/task.md in strict format:

# Tasks

- [ ] Task 1 ...
- [ ] Task 2 ...

Rules:

- Tasks must be concrete and file-scoped when possible.
- Do not include design discussion.
- Must comply with .flow/decision.md constraints.

After writing, run:

- scripts/flow.sh status

Do NOT commit or push.
